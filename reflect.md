# Reflectiion

I learnt a lot of things in this assignment, such as how to create a complex hex grid and be find which hex tiles are neighboraing a given tile accuratly. I also learnt how to balance the game by adding powerups to keep the game entertaining for a long period of time. It looks simple at first, but this assignment required a lot of thought into the design and how to keep it responsice at multiple resolutions. This assignment also solidified my Next.js development skills and will aid me in completing the group project component of this course.
