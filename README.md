### Target platform
Desktop, tablet (also works on mobile)

### Game genre
Strategy, Board game

### Game objective
- control more tiles than the other player before either of you run out of moves!

### Rules
- Click on a tile when it is your turn. 
- You can only select a tile if it neighbors one of your controlled tiles. (1 tile away in all directions) 
- You can select the other player's tile, however there will be a random challenge to complete for a successful takeover. 
- Once all tiles are selected, the player with the most tiles wins. 
- If a player has no valid moves the game ends and player with most tiles wins.
- There are 3 powerups in the game; one grants you an extra turn, one lets you destroy the other player's tile, and one is a bomb that gets control of nearby tiles (including the other player's!).

### Game mechanics
- Click on tile
- Hidden powerups (destroy other player's tile, extra turn, bomb to control all neighbor tiles)
